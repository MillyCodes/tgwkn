						<h2><em>TGWKN is a project by me, Milly. I'm learning to code my own webpages and yes, it's full of struggle.
  		</em></h2>
						<p>After playing with coding as a hobby most of my life I have finally decided that it may be worth it to actually formally learn HTML, CSS and even more importantly JavaScript and JQuery. It was fun and easy at first however, the truth is IT'S FUCKING
							HARD. You won't find me smiling and acting as if life smells like roses while I'm learning because I am actually frustrated but I am also determined to learn this shit. Ultimately, I know it's worth it.</p>

					<h3>You can also subscribe by email</h3>
					<p>So I don't have a newsletter or whatever but if I did it would totally be awesome. I don't have a normal schedule so I'd be the type to send newsletters pretty sporadically and it would be cool to do. In the mean time, enter your email if you dare.</p>

					<h3>Ask me anything</h3>
					<p>Look, I don't do this often but here is your chance to ask me what ever you want. I can't guarantee that I'll answer but you can take a risk here as well. <a href="twitter.com">Click here to tweet me</a> which I prefer, or you can also <a href="mailto#me">email me</a>

					<h3>What I've learned</h3>
					<p>I found this great post about things you should <a href="#">learn and do to become a web developer</a> and it's been helpful so far.
						<ul>
							<li><a href="#">HTML & CSS are like nice little walks in the park</a></li>
							<li><a href="#">Javascript is like walkng through the mud on a damn day</a></li>
							<li><a href="#">With jQuery at least you have a jacket and rainboots on</a></li>
							<li><a href="#">Ok, but, I'm still walking in the mud though.</a></li>
							<li><a href="#">Oh shit, it's about to be a fucking thunderstorm</a></li>
							<li><a href="#">O.M.G. IS THAT A TORNADO!</a></li>
